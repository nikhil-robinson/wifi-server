CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol): CoAP is a lightweight protocol designed for use in constrained environments, such as IoT devices. It is similar to HTTP but is more efficient and has a smaller footprint.

AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol): AMQP is a messaging protocol that provides reliable, secure, and efficient communication between applications. It is often used in distributed systems and can be used for both publish/subscribe and point-to-point communication.

DDS (Data Distribution Service): DDS is a protocol that provides high-performance, scalable, and reliable data communication between distributed systems. It is designed for use in real-time systems and supports both publish/subscribe and point-to-point communication.

Modbus: Modbus is a protocol used in industrial automation systems to communicate with PLCs, sensors, and other devices. It supports both serial and Ethernet communication and is widely used in the manufacturing industry.

OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture): OPC UA is a protocol used for communication between devices and applications in industrial automation systems. It provides a secure and reliable way to exchange data and is designed to be interoperable with a wide range of devices and systems.

Each of these protocols has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application.
